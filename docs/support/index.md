### Answer

This is an error in the IIS web server. The default limitation of "url parts" (segments) to 260 characters, so if you have long(er) nested area names this error can occur. This setting can be modified in the Windows Registry using the Registry Editor.

> This solution contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, see [How to back up and restore the registry in Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/help/322756)

Start the Registry Editor with administrative privileges.

Navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\HTTP\Parameters`.

Create a new `REG_DWORD` in called `UrlSegmentMaxLength`.

Set its value to 400 hex or 1024 decimal.

Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.

## Arrigo button in view maneuver open document does not work

### Question
Open document work with link icons, why doesn't it work in view buttons?

### Answer
We recommend instead to use the OpenLink option in the button and redirect to the configured linkIcon with the document.
During 2022/2023 we will build Arrigo Studio with the new viewdesigner, therefore we do not want to alter too much in the existing view designer as it is legacy code.

## Use Arrigo's process management for my own services

### Question
If I have my own Node.JS application, can I piggy-back on Arrigo's services to manage startup and shutdown

### Answer
Arrigo uses a process manager called PM2 for its process management. At a glance it is an advanced process manager for production Node.js applications with load balancer, logs facility, startup script and micro service management.

PM2 uses a file called ecosystem.config.js and it is located in your project folder (eg. C:\EXO Projects\Regin\Arrigo\pm2). All documentation about the file is located here: 
[https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)

In short, add an entry (the command line command) to that file with the information of the Node.JS application you wish to run with Arrigo. 
Attach the project again and the Node.JS application should be started.
