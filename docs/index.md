### Latest changes
We have replaced the core template parser (also known as transpiler, or maker). This means that performance is improved for all views and routes in the system. 

We have also a breaking change: 
- `Web:` translates to `Shared:/web` in all views.
Make sure you copy all your resources to your project Shared folder before.

We also have a **known issue** with *Icon support in Buttons*. We are working on that issue now.

We have upgraded stable to our latest version. The latest is the new version including above changes.

We strongly recommend that you test out our (really fast) latest version.

If you encounter problems in your project, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
